+# Traffic Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
+
+## Project Overview
+This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict traffic situations based on various features such as time, day of the week, and vehicle counts. The model is designed to help city transportation departments evaluate various factors before making decisions about traffic management and infrastructure improvements.
+
+## Problem Statement
+City transportation departments need to evaluate various factors before making decisions about traffic management and infrastructure improvements. The objective of this project is to optimize the process of monitoring and analyzing urban traffic congestion by leveraging vehicle count data collected through computer vision.
+
+## Dataset Description
+The dataset contains traffic information with the following features:
+- **Vehicle Counts**: CarCount, BikeCount, BusCount, TruckCount
+- **Time Information**: Time (in hours), Date, Day of the week
+- **Total**: Total count of all vehicle types detected within a 15-minute duration
+- **Target Variable**: Traffic Situation (categorical)
+
+### Key Dataset Characteristics:
+- The model detects four classes of vehicles: cars, bikes, buses, and trucks
+- Vehicle counts are recorded in 15-minute intervals
+- Date ranges from 1 to 31, representing days of the month
+- CarCount ranges from 5 to 180 cars per interval
+- BikeCount ranges from 0 to 70 bikes
+- BusCount ranges from 0 to 50 buses
+- TruckCount ranges from 0 to 60 trucks
+- Total vehicles per interval range from 21 to 279
+
+## Methodology
+
+### Data Preprocessing
+1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
+   - Univariate analysis of continuous and categorical variables
+   - Bivariate analysis to understand relationships between features
+   - Visualization of traffic patterns by hour and day of the week
+
+2. **Feature Engineering**
+   - Log transformation of BikeCount, BusCount, and TruckCount to handle skewness
+   - Conversion of time to hour of day
+   - Numerical encoding of day of the week
+   - Label encoding of the target variable (Traffic Situation)
+
+3. **Data Preparation**
+   - Train-test split (80-20)
+   - Standardization of numerical features
+
+### Model Architecture
+The ANN model consists of:
+- Input layer with features: CarCount, log-transformed vehicle counts, Time, Date, Day of the week, etc.
+- First hidden layer: 32 neurons with ReLU activation
+- Second hidden layer: 16 neurons with ReLU activation
+- Output layer: 4 neurons (one for each traffic situation class)
+- Loss function: Cross-Entropy Loss
+- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate of 0.001
+
+### Training Process
+- Batch size: 128 for training, 256 for testing
+- Number of epochs: 40
+- Training and validation loss monitoring
+
+## Implementation Details
+- **Framework**: PyTorch
+- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
+- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
+- **Evaluation Metrics**: Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
+
+## Results
+The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each traffic situation class. The training process shows a decreasing loss curve, indicating successful learning.
+
+## Usage
+1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
+   ```
+   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch
+   ```
+
+2. Place the 'Traffic.csv' file in the same directory as the script
+
+3. Run the script:
+   ```
+   python traffic_prediction_ann.py
+   ```
+
+## Future Improvements
+- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
+- Exploration of more complex architectures (e.g., deeper networks)
+- Incorporation of additional features such as weather conditions
+- Deployment as a real-time prediction system
